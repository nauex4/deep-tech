<h1>What is Machine Learning?</h1>
<img src="mas.png"alt="Machine learning" class="title-image">
<p>Machine Learning (ML) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on teaching computers how to learn from data instead of following only fixed instructions. Instead of telling a computer exactly what to do step by step, we give it many examples, and the computer figures out patterns on its own. This makes it possible for machines to improve their performance over time, just like people learn from practice.</p>
<p>The main idea behind Machine Learning is that a system can analyze past information and use it to make predictions or decisions about new situations. For example, if you train an ML system with thousands of pictures of cats and dogs, it can later recognize whether a brand-new picture shows a cat or a dog—even if it has never seen that picture before. This ability to generalize from past data makes ML very powerful.</p>
<p>Today, Machine Learning is used in many parts of everyday life. Streaming platforms like YouTube and Netflix recommend videos and movies based on what you’ve watched before. Email services filter out spam messages automatically. Even self-driving cars rely on ML to recognize roads, signs, and obstacles. In short, Machine Learning is a technology that helps computers learn, adapt, and make smarter choices without needing constant human instructions.</p>
<p>Machine Learning can be thought of as giving computers the ability to learn from experience, rather than just following strict rules. Traditional programs depend on exact instructions, but Machine Learning systems improve their behavior by studying examples, identifying patterns, and adjusting automatically. This shift makes technology far more flexible and useful in complex situations.</p>
<p>At its core, Machine Learning uses algorithms that process large amounts of data to make predictions or decisions. For instance, when you shop online, the system observes what items you view or buy, then suggests other products you might like. The more data the system receives, the better it becomes at predicting your preferences. It’s almost like the computer is training itself to understand you better over time.</p>
<p>Because of this, Machine Learning is now deeply integrated into daily life. Search engines use it to deliver more accurate results, banks use it to detect unusual transactions, and medical researchers apply it to help identify diseases earlier. In each case, the goal is the same: to let machines adapt, improve, and provide smarter solutions by learning from real-world information.</p>
