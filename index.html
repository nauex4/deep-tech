<h1>What is AI?</h1>
<img src="ai.png" alt="Future of AI" class="title-image">
<p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is like teaching computers how to think, learn, and solve problems in ways that feel similar to humans. Instead of just following fixed instructions, AI systems can recognize patterns, make predictions, and even adapt when given new information. It’s what allows your phone to recognize your face, or a search engine to guess what you’re looking for before you finish typing.</p>
<p>What makes AI special is that it doesn’t just store information—it learns from experience. For example, when you show an AI thousands of photos of cats, it figures out the patterns that make a cat a cat: the shape of the ears, the eyes, the whiskers. Then, when you show it a brand-new picture, it can say, “That’s a cat!” even if it has never seen that exact picture before. This ability to learn and improve is what sets AI apart from traditional computer programs.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, AI is expected to transform the future in ways we can’t fully imagine yet. From self-driving cars to personalized learning, AI has the potential to make life easier, faster, and more connected. But the key is balance: using AI not as a replacement for human creativity and wisdom, but as a tool to support and empower people. The better we understand how AI works, the smarter we’ll be in shaping its role in our world.</p>
<p>Even though AI is powerful, it still has limits. It doesn’t truly “think” or “feel” the way humans do—it works by analyzing huge amounts of data and following mathematical rules. If the data it learns from is incomplete or biased, the results can also be flawed. That’s why humans are always needed to guide, improve, and check AI systems, making sure they are used responsibly and fairly</p>
